# HexFileViewer 🔢🔍
> A simple HexFileViewer written in C

## ⚙️Compiling
```bash
git clone https://github.com/remyone/HexFileViewer.git
cd HexFileViewer/
make main
./main filename
```

## 🔥 Motivation
The major motivation is to learn working with files at a low level and manipulation with bytes. Plus, I wanted to revise and practice memory management via pointers and allocation/deallocation. Here are some of the concepts I've learned writing this mini project:
- Manipulation of bits/bytes with different data size types
- Reading particular bytes and extracting them into a buffer
- Converting decimal to hexadecimal through snprintf
- Importance of using local variables and give them to functions instead of global variables
